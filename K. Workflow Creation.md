
# Understanding AIRA Workflow

AIRA Workflow, also referred to as "Jobs," is a systematic sequence of tasks or activities designed to automate specific business processes within the AIRA platform. Each workflow, or job, consists of a series of interconnected steps that define the logic and flow of operations to be executed automatically.

  

Through the Jobs feature, users can create, manage, and execute automation workflows tailored to their specific needs and objectives. These workflows can range from simple, linear processes to complex, branching sequences, depending on the requirements of the task at hand.

  

By defining workflows in Jobs, users can streamline and optimise repetitive tasks, improve operational efficiency, and reduce manual effort. With the flexibility and customization options offered by AIRA Workflow, users can design automation solutions that align with their unique business processes and objectives.
