# Exploring AIRA Cases Human Activity <img align="right" width="140" height="40" src="https://github.com/airacommunity/AIRA-User-Guide-Images/blob/main/ARIA%20Logo%202.png?raw=true">

## Overview
Cases in AIRA are integral components of workflows, representing stages where human interaction or decision-making is required. But to understand “Cases” first we have to understand the “Forms” app activity.To learn about AIRA forms, visit the [AIRA Form](url) section.

Forms in AIRA workflows play a crucial role in facilitating human-centric activities and data collection within processes.

- **Human Activity Focus:** Form app is designed to cater to human-centric tasks within workflows.
- **Data Collection Hub:** This app serves as a central hub for collecting and processing human-inputted data.

## Relationship Between Form and Workflow
When the Form module is incorporated into a workflow, it automatically triggers the creation of a corresponding case. Cases essentially function as sub-parts of the Form module, dedicated to capturing and processing data specific to the form. The data entered within the case corresponds to the respective form fields established within the workflow, establishing a smooth connection between human-driven interactions and the structured data collection process. This integral relationship ensures that the workflow progresses efficiently, using the captured data for further processing and automation.

## Assignment Rules and Case Types:
- **Workflow Integration:** Cases are generated when “Form” are included in workflow, and assignment rules play a pivotal role in determining the case type.
- **Dynamic Categorization:** Based on assignment rules, cases are dynamically categorized into Inbox, Unassigned, Participated, and more.

## Cases User Interface
The user interface of Aira Cases features five primary options: "Start Execution," "Inbox Section," "Participated," "Unassigned," and "Advanced Search."

### Inbox
When the form's assignment rule is set to manual assignment to a specific person, the case is directed to the Inbox of that individual.

**Example:** A workflow assigns a form to "vishwajeet.aira" via manual assignment rule, the case will appear in the Inbox of the designated user.

Alternatively, if the assignment rule is set to "reports to" a specific person, the case is directed to the inbox of the reporting manager.
