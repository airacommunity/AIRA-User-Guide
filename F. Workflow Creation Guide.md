## Creating a New Job in AIRA - Step by Step

- Navigate to the left navigation console and click on the "Jobs" option to open a dedicated window for job-related functionalities.
- If needed, Utilize the search bar located on the top right corner of the job window to search for existing workflows by their names.
- If needed, use the import button next to the search bar to import a workflow into the platform.
- Within the Jobs window, locate and click on the "Add New Job" option to begin the process of creating a new workflow.
- Fill in the relevant details such as the "Job Name" and provide a concise "Job Description" that outlines the purpose of the job.
- After entering all necessary information, click on the "Submit" button to confirm the creation of the new job.
- Once the job is successfully created, double-click on the newly created job to open the AIRA designer, which facilitates task automation.

- **Export Workflow:** The Export Workflow option permits users to export a version of the workflow, facilitating documentation and sharing with collaborators.
- **Auto Layout Button:** The Auto Layout button automates the arrangement and organisation of workflow elements, enhancing visual clarity and aesthetics.

### Execution Bar in AIRA Workflow Console : Top Left Corner

Positioned at the top left of the AIRA Workflow Console, three essential options empower users with specific functionalities.

- **Workflow Option:** Clicking on the Workflow option directs users to the primary workflow window. This is the central space where users actively create, modify, and configure their workflows.
- **Execution History Option:** This feature provides users with a portal to review the historical execution of their workflows. Users can access detailed information about past executions, facilitating performance analysis and troubleshooting.
Search Bar: Positioned on the left-hand side of the section, the search bar allows users to conveniently search for executions by their unique execution IDs.
  - Execution Status Indicators:
    - Green Tick: Indicates successful execution of the workflow.
    - Red Tick: Highlights errors encountered during execution.
    - Yellow Tick: Flags warnings that occurred during execution.
- **Logs Option:** Clicking on the Logs option grants users access to the execution logs of the workflow. These logs provide detailed information about the sequence of events during the execution process, facilitating debugging and analysis.

### AIRA Workflow Execution Bar - Top Right Corner 

In the top-right corner of the AIRA Workflow Console, five buttons provide users with essential controls and insights into the status and execution of their workflows.

- **Stop Workflow Button:** Clicking on the Stop Workflow Button allows users to halt the execution of the workflow. This can be crucial in situations where an immediate stoppage is required.
- **Retry Workflow Button :** The retry Workflow Button enables users to replay or restart the workflow from the beginning. This functionality can be useful for testing, refining, or re-executing a workflow.
- **Pause Workflow Button:** Clicking on the Pause Workflow Button enables users to temporarily halt the execution of the workflow. This is beneficial when users need to review or address certain aspects of the workflow.
- **Resume:** This feature allows the user to resume the execution of a workflow that has been paused, enabling seamless continuation of the workflow from the point where it was paused.

### To Create Workflow In AIRA

- **Plan the Task:** Identify the specific task or process you want to automate. Determine which steps are repetitive and can be automated using AIRA.
- **Choose Required Apps:** Select the appropriate apps from AIRA's app library that will help you automate the identified task. Consider apps for data retrieval, manipulation, communication, or integration with external services like Mailchimp or Google Drive.
- **Plan the Logic:** Define the logic and sequence of actions for your workflow. Decide how the apps will interact with each other to achieve the desired outcome.
- **Make Connections:** Set up connections for the required apps according to the workflow logic. Ensure that data flows seamlessly between apps and that each app performs its designated function.
- **Create Learning Instance (if required):** If your workflow involves Intelligent Document Processing (IDP), create a learning instance in the IDP section of AIRA. Train the instance with relevant documents to enable automated document processing.
- **Create Machine Learning Models (if required):** If your workflow requires models, develop and train them in the Models section of AIRA. These models can be integrated into your workflow to perform tasks like classification, prediction, or sentiment analysis.
- **Open Workflow Designer:** Access the Workflow Designer in AIRA and start creating your workflow. Drag and drop the selected apps, variables, tools and other aira activities onto the designer and arrange them according to the planned logic.
- **Configure App Settings:** Double-click on each app to configure its settings as per your requirements. Enter necessary parameters, credentials, or data sources to ensure proper functionality.
- **Connect Apps:** Use connectors to link the output of one app to the input of another, forming a logical flow of data and actions within the workflow.
- **Test the Workflow:** Before running the workflow in a production environment, thoroughly test it to ensure all apps are functioning correctly and the workflow logic is achieving the desired outcome.
- **Run the Workflow**: Once testing is complete and you are satisfied with the workflow's performance, run it to automate the designated task or process.
- **Monitor and Iterate:** Monitor the workflow's performance over time and make adjustments as needed. Iterate on the workflow design to optimise efficiency and address any issues that arise during operation.
