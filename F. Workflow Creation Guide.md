- Navigate to the left navigation console and click on the "Jobs" option to open a dedicated window for job-related functionalities.
- If needed, Utilize the search bar located on the top right corner of the job window to search for existing workflows by their names.
- If needed, use the import button next to the search bar to import a workflow into the platform.
- Within the Jobs window, locate and click on the "Add New Job" option to begin the process of creating a new workflow.
- Fill in the relevant details such as the "Job Name" and provide a concise "Job Description" that outlines the purpose of the job.
- After entering all necessary information, click on the "Submit" button to confirm the creation of the new job.
- Once the job is successfully created, double-click on the newly created job to open the AIRA designer, which facilitates task automation.
- If locating the newly created job is challenging, utilize the search bar to find it by its name. Then, double-click on the job to open the Workflow console "Designer."

### To Create Workflow In AIRA

- **Plan the Task:** Identify the specific task or process you want to automate. Determine which steps are repetitive and can be automated using AIRA.
- **Choose Required Apps:** Select the appropriate apps from AIRA's app library that will help you automate the identified task. Consider apps for data retrieval, manipulation, communication, or integration with external services like Mailchimp or Google Drive.
- **Plan the Logic:** Define the logic and sequence of actions for your workflow. Decide how the apps will interact with each other to achieve the desired outcome.
- **Make Connections:** Set up connections for the required apps according to the workflow logic. Ensure that data flows seamlessly between apps and that each app performs its designated function.
- **Create Learning Instance (if required):** If your workflow involves Intelligent Document Processing (IDP), create a learning instance in the IDP section of AIRA. Train the instance with relevant documents to enable automated document processing.
- **Create Machine Learning Models (if required):** If your workflow requires models, develop and train them in the Models section of AIRA. These models can be integrated into your workflow to perform tasks like classification, prediction, or sentiment analysis.
- **Open Workflow Designer:** Access the Workflow Designer in AIRA and start creating your workflow. Drag and drop the selected apps, variables, tools and other aira activities onto the designer and arrange them according to the planned logic.
- **Configure App Settings:** Double-click on each app to configure its settings as per your requirements. Enter necessary parameters, credentials, or data sources to ensure proper functionality.
- **Connect Apps:** Use connectors to link the output of one app to the input of another, forming a logical flow of data and actions within the workflow.
- **Test the Workflow:** Before running the workflow in a production environment, thoroughly test it to ensure all apps are functioning correctly and the workflow logic is achieving the desired outcome.
- **Run the Workflow**: Once testing is complete and you are satisfied with the workflow's performance, run it to automate the designated task or process.
- **Monitor and Iterate:** Monitor the workflow's performance over time and make adjustments as needed. Iterate on the workflow design to optimise efficiency and address any issues that arise during operation.
