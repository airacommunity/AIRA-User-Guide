## Overview

AIRA, which stands for Artificial Intelligence Robotic Automation, is a state-of-the-art hyper-automation platform designed to redefine the way enterprises operate. By smoothly integrating cutting-edge technologies, including Natural Language Processing, Intelligent Document Processing, and Robotic Process Automation, AIRA offers a comprehensive solution for businesses seeking to optimise their processes.

AIRA Automation follows a 3-step process: strategize, streamline, and transform.

| Strategy   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Strategize | Initially, we focus on strategizing the process. This involves identifying the problem statement that needs automation, defining the steps involved in the process, specifying any conditions that apply, and developing a comprehensive strategy to address the automation needs. |
| Streamline | Next, we streamline all processes within the automation chain. AIRA ensures seamless integration of all necessary apps and connections within the workflow process using our automation designer. This step aims to optimize efficiency and enhance workflow performance.             |
| Transform  | Lastly, we initiate the transformation phase. Here, we implement the strategies and streamline processes to bring about significant improvements. Through automation, AIRA enables businesses to achieve enhanced productivity, reduced manual intervention, and improved outcomes.  |
