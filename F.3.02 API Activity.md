## API Call Overview

The API Call app in AIRA allows users to interact with external APIs by making HTTP requests. It supports various HTTP methods such as GET, PUT, POST, and PATCH, enabling users to retrieve data, update resources, create new resources, or partially update existing resources.

## API Authentication Overview

The API Authentication app in AIRA facilitates secure access to external APIs by providing authentication mechanisms. It supports different types of authentication, including API key, basic authentication, OAuth 2.0, and no authorization. This ensures that only authorised users or applications can access the APIs.

### Use in AIRA

-   Both apps play crucial roles in integrating AIRA workflows with external systems and services.
    
-   The API Call app enables the execution of API requests to perform various operations, such as fetching data from external sources or updating remote resources.
    
-   The API Authentication app ensures secure communication with external APIs by handling authentication protocols, thereby safeguarding sensitive data and resources.
    
-   Together, these apps empower users to automate complex processes, interact with external systems, and leverage the capabilities of external APIs within AIRA workflows.
