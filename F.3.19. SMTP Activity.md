## Overview
SMTP, or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, is a standard protocol used for sending email messages between servers. It allows email systems to communicate and transfer messages over the internet.

In the context of AIRA workflow, SMTP is used to send emails as part of automated processes. AIRA integrates SMTP functionality into its workflow system, allowing users to incorporate email notifications, alerts, or other communication mechanisms seamlessly into their automated workflows.

By configuring SMTP settings within AIRA workflow, users can set up triggers or actions that send email notifications to designated recipients based on specific events or conditions. This capability enhances workflow automation by enabling real-time communication and notifications, facilitating smoother collaboration and information dissemination within organisations.
