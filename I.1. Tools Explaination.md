### Set Variable
The Set Variable tool is a component utilized within workflow design environments to establish and define input variables. By incorporating the Set Variable tool into a workflow and establishing connections with other tools or applications, these downstream elements gain access to the variable generated by the Set Variable tool.

#### How to Use the Set Variable Tool:

   - Drag the "Set Variable" tool onto your workflow canvas.

- **Connect:**
   - Connect the "Set Variable" tool to the app or tool where you want to apply the variable.
   - This can be done by dragging a connection line from the output of the preceding action to the input of the "Set Variable" tool.

- **Configure:**
   - Double-click on the "Set Variable" tool to open its settings.
   - In the settings, you will find the Input field.
   - Define the Input: Input the information you want to assign to the variable.

### Switch
The "Switch" tool in AIRA Designer allows users to implement conditional branching within their workflow, directing the flow of actions based on specified conditions.

#### How to Use the Switch Tool:

- **Drag and Drop:**
   - Find the "Switch" tool in the Tools Section of the AIRA Designer interface.
   - Drag the "Switch" tool onto your workflow canvas.

- **Connect:**
   - Connect the "Switch" tool to the required place in your workflow where you want to implement conditional branching.
   - This can be done by dragging connection lines from the output of the preceding action to the input of the "Switch" tool and connect output of the switch tool with the multiple apps which you want to switch according to conditions.

- **Open Switch Configuration:**
   - Locate the "Switch" tool in your workflow.
   - Double-click on the "Switch" tool to access its configuration settings.

- **Define Logic Expression:**

   - Within the configuration window, locate the expression field for defining the logic of the switch process.
   - Construct an expression that encapsulates the conditions and actions for directing the workflow.
   - Utilize operators such as greater than (>), less than (<), equal to (=), etc., within the expression.
   - Incorporate variables within the expression to enable dynamic evaluation.
   - ``` For example: $$workflow.variables.result.age$$ >= 12 ```
- **Ensure Accuracy:**
   - Review the expression to ensure it accurately captures the intended logic for directing the workflow.
   - Verify that all conditions and corresponding actions are appropriately defined.

- **Set Branching Conditions:**
   - After defining the expression, proceed to set the operator and conditions for branching applications or tools.
   - Optionally, apply logical operators such as AND and OR to combine multiple branching conditions.

- **Submit Configuration:**
   - Once satisfied with the configuration, click on the "Submit" button to save the settings.

- **Additional Options:**

  Right-click on the "Switch" tool in the AIRA Designer workflow to encounter five available options:

### Terminate
Terminate refers to a tool used to abruptly stop a process or task before it finishes naturally. This tool is handy when there's a need to halt an operation due to an error, a specific condition, or as part of the planned workflow logic. By activating "Terminate," the ongoing task immediately ceases, preventing any further actions from taking place. This feature offers control and flexibility, enabling users to manage workflow flow according to specific needs and circumstances.
