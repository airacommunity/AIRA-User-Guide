## Overiview
An AIRA model refers to a computational framework designed within the AIRA platform to facilitate predictive analytics, automation, and intelligent decision-making. These models utilize various machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques to process input data, generate insights, and produce actionable predictions.

### Key Components of an AIRA Model:

- **Input Data:** AIRA models require input data, which can be in the form of structured datasets such as CSV, JSON, Excel files, or connected databases like Google Sheets, PostgreSQL, or MySQL. This data serves as the foundation for training and generating predictions.
- **Training Phase:** During the training phase, the model learns patterns and relationships within the input data. This involves selecting appropriate features and defining the target variable for prediction. The model is trained using machine learning algorithms to optimize its predictive capabilities.
- **Prediction Phase:** Once trained, the model can be used to make predictions on new or unseen data. Users can input feature values into the model to obtain predictive results. Additionally, datasets can be uploaded for batch prediction tasks.
- **Deployment:** After satisfactory performance during the prediction phase, the model can be deployed for operational use within the AIRA platform. Deployment involves providing a name for the model and confirming the deployment process.
- **Integration:** Deployed models can be seamlessly integrated into various workflows and applications within the AIRA platform. They serve as powerful tools for automation, intelligence, and optimization, enhancing operational efficiency and decision-making processes.

## How to Create an AIRA Model

1. **Navigate to Model Section:**
   - Go to the left navigation menu and click on the "Model" option. This action will open the model window.

2. **Search Existing Models (Optional):**
   - In the model section, there is a search bar available. Use this search bar to find any previously uploaded or created models if needed.

3. **Create a New Model:**
   - To create a new model, click on the "Create New Model" button.

4. **Enter Model Name:**
   - A window will appear prompting you to enter a name for your new model. Provide a descriptive name for your model.

5. **Confirm Model Creation and Open:**
   - Click on the "Create New Model" button to confirm the creation of your model.
   - Search for the model by its name in the model section and click on it to open.

6. **Connect Training Dataset:**
   - The first step is to connect the training dataset. Click on the upload button and select your dataset. AIRA models accept datasets in CSV or Excel format.
   - After selecting the dataset, the data distribution chart and data table will be shown in the "Connect Training Data" section.
   - After uploading data set, user can change the data type of columns in (Numberic, Date Time, ID , Text, Categorical Etc)
   - If needed, you can change the dataset by clicking on the "Change" button.

7. **Proceed to Model Training:**
   - After connecting the dataset, click on the "Next" button to move forward.
   - In the model training section, identify the target and features of the dataset for training the model.

8. **Start Training:**
   - Once you have selected the target and features, click on the "Start Training" button to begin the model training process.

9. **Review Model Summary:**
   - After training, a summary of the model, top fields, and dataset will be displayed.

10. **Fill in Feature Values for Prediction:**
    - To get predictive results, fill in feature values. You can upload feature values using the "Upload" option.

11. **Submit Prediction:**
    - After filling in the feature values, click on the "Submit" button for prediction.

12. **Deploy the Model:**
    - If satisfied with the prediction results, Provide an activity name and click on the "Deploy" button located below.

13. **Model Deployment Confirmation:**
    - Your model is now deployed and ready for use in your AIRA workflows.


As we wrap up this section, envision with me the transformative power that models bring to AIRA. The knowledge gained here sets the stage for us to leverage models as catalysts for automation, intelligence, and operational excellence within your AIRA-driven workflows.
