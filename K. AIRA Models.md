## Overiview
An AIRA model refers to a computational framework designed within the AIRA platform to facilitate predictive analytics, automation, and intelligent decision-making. These models utilize various machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques to process input data, generate insights, and produce actionable predictions.

### Key Components of an AIRA Model:

- **Input Data:** AIRA models require input data, which can be in the form of structured datasets such as CSV, JSON, Excel files, or connected databases like Google Sheets, PostgreSQL, or MySQL. This data serves as the foundation for training and generating predictions.
- **Training Phase:** During the training phase, the model learns patterns and relationships within the input data. This involves selecting appropriate features and defining the target variable for prediction. The model is trained using machine learning algorithms to optimize its predictive capabilities.
- **Prediction Phase:** Once trained, the model can be used to make predictions on new or unseen data. Users can input feature values into the model to obtain predictive results. Additionally, datasets can be uploaded for batch prediction tasks.
- **Deployment:** After satisfactory performance during the prediction phase, the model can be deployed for operational use within the AIRA platform. Deployment involves providing a name for the model and confirming the deployment process.
- **Integration:** Deployed models can be seamlessly integrated into various workflows and applications within the AIRA platform. They serve as powerful tools for automation, intelligence, and optimization, enhancing operational efficiency and decision-making processes.

## How to Create AIRA Model ?

- Navigate left navigation and click on the model, model window open.
- In model section a search bar is availabe in it, with the help of search bar user can search previous uploaded or created models.
- to create model click on the "Create New Model" button.
- A pop-up window will appear where you can enter a name for your new model.
- Click on the "Create New Model" button.
- The first step is to connect the training dataset, click on the upload button. Model can take CSV or Excel Formate data set.
- after selecting data set the data set table shown in Connect Training Data, Table shown the data distribution chart and data.
- With Change button user can change  data set.
- After connet the data set click on the next button to move forward.
- Next section is model training, there are 2 section in it target and features. select thte target and feature of the data set. for trainin the model.
- After selecting target and feature click on start training.
- after start training, it shows the summary  of the model, top fields, and data set.
- After training the data set click on the nextto mode forward
- Fill in feature values to get predictive results.
- user can use the "Upload" option to to upload feature for prediction.
- Click on the subnit button for prediction
- If satisfied with the prediction results, click on the "Deploy" button located below.
- Provide an activating name and confirm deployment.
- Your model is now deployed and ready for use in your AIRA workflows.
- 

### Step 1: naviigate left menu of aira and click on the model tab.

### Step 2: Add a New Model
- Within the Model Section, locate and click on the "Add New Model" option.
- A pop-up window will appear where you can enter a name for your new model.
- Click on the "Create New Model" button.

### Step 3: Connect Training Dataset
- Upon clicking, a new window will open, initiating the new model creation workflow.
- The first step is to connect the training dataset.
- Choose from multiple options:
  - Table: Upload CSV, Json, or Excel data types.
  - Google Sheets, PostgreSQL, MySQL: (Note: In Progress)
  - For the "Table" option, a new window will open where you can drag and drop the dataset. Use the search bar to find and connect previous datasets.
  - Once attributes are correctly uploaded, click the "Next" button to complete the data connection process.

### Step 4: Model Training
- Proceed to the model training phase.
- Two options available: "Target" and "Features."
- In "Target," select the final output to predict. In "Features," choose predictive features.
- Click on "Start Training" to initiate the model training process.
- After completion, a summary of the training dataset, including accuracy percentage, will be displayed.

### Step 5: Training Summary
- The summary section presents AI algorithm details, accuracy percentage, RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) values.
- Another summary section highlights the top fields contributing to predictions and their data distribution.
- The last summary section provides a comparison sheet between Actual and Predicted Values.

### Step 6: Model Prediction
- Clicking "Next" opens the model prediction section.
- Fill in feature values to get predictive results.

Use the "Upload" option to predict datasets by uploading CSV, JSON, or Excel files.

### Step 7: Model Deployment
- If satisfied with the prediction results, click on the "Deploy" button located below.
- Provide an activating name and confirm deployment.
- Your model is now deployed and ready for use in your AIRA workflows.

### Step 8: Model Integration
- Utilise the deployed model seamlessly in various workflows within the AIRA platform.
- Enjoy the benefits of predictive analytics and enhanced automation using your newly created model.

As we wrap up this section, envision with me the transformative power that models bring to AIRA. The knowledge gained here sets the stage for us to leverage models as catalysts for automation, intelligence, and operational excellence within your AIRA-driven workflows.
