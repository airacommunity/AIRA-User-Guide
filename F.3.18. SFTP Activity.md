# SFTP Activity <img align="right" width="140" height="40" src="https://github.com/airacommunity/AIRA-User-Guide-Images/blob/main/ARIA%20Logo%202.png?raw=true">

## Overview

SFTP, which stands for Secure File Transfer Protocol, is a network protocol used to securely transfer files over a computer network. It's designed to ensure that data is protected during transmission by encrypting files, making it difficult for unauthorised users to access or intercept them.

In AIRA, SFTP plays a crucial role in securely uploading files to remote systems or downloading them onto the local system. This is particularly important for transferring sensitive data like automation scripts and configuration files between users and the AIRA platform. By using SFTP, we ensure that the transfer process maintains data integrity and confidentiality, safeguarding information from potential security threats.
