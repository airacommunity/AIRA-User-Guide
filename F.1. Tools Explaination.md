## Exploring Logical Tools in AIRA

### Fork Join and Join
The "Join" and "Fork Join" tools in AIRA Designer facilitate parallel execution of multiple tasks or applications within a workflow. They enable the simultaneous execution of these tasks and ensure that the workflow progresses to the next activity once all parallel tasks have been completed. This allows for efficient management of concurrent processes within the workflow environment.

### Terminate
Terminate refers to a tool used to abruptly stop a process or task before it finishes naturally. This tool is handy when there's a need to halt an operation due to an error, a specific condition, or as part of the planned workflow logic. By activating "Terminate," the ongoing task immediately ceases, preventing any further actions from taking place. This feature offers control and flexibility, enabling users to manage workflow flow according to specific needs and circumstances.
