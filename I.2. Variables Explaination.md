In AIRA, the Variables feature plays a pivotal role in facilitating efficient data management within your workflows. Variables act as containers for storing and manipulating essential information, enabling users to keep their data organised and adaptable to diverse workflows. Whether you're collecting data through forms or creating custom variables created to your specific needs, AIRA's Variable Section empowers you with enhanced control over your data processing.

When you create a form in AIRA, each component of the form automatically translates into a global variable. This seamless integration ensures that the data collected through forms is readily accessible across your entire workflow without any additional configuration. Thus, users can leverage collected data effortlessly, streamlining data handling processes and enhancing overall efficiency.

## Tailored Variable Creation:

AIRA's Variable Section offers users the flexibility to create custom variables tailored to their unique requirements. Users can specify the type of variable needed, such as text, numbers, dates, and more, along with providing a descriptive name and purpose for the variable. This customization capability empowers users to align their data setup precisely with their workflow, fostering optimal efficiency and productivity.

### Enhanced Workflow Control:

By strategically utilising variables within their workflows, users gain greater control over data movement and manipulation. Variables enable seamless storage, retrieval, and modification of information as needed, empowering users to make their processes smarter and more adaptable. With AIRA's Variable Section, users can optimise their workflows by efficiently managing data flow and responding dynamically to changing requirements.
