## Overview
A variable is a storage in a workflow that holds a value. Variables are fundamental in worklfow automation because they allow developers to work with data dynamically. In workflow automation, variables typically have a data type, which determines the kind of data they can store (such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, etc.). Variables must often be declared before they can be used, specifying both their name and data type. Whether user collecting data through forms or creating custom variables to specific needs, AIRA's Variable Section empowers with enhanced control over your data processing.

### Global Variables:

In AIRA, global variables are automatically generated when creating forms within the platform. Each fields of the form corresponds to a global variable, facilitating seamless integration of collected data across the entire workflow. This integration enabling users to effortlessly access collected data and streamline data handling processes. Global variables enhance overall efficiency by ensuring that data collected through forms is readily available for use throughout the workflow.

### Custom Variable:

In AIRA, custom variables are user-defined variables created within the Variable Section to suit specific requirements. Users have the flexibility to specify the type of variable needed, including text, numbers, dates, and more, along with providing a descriptive name and purpose. This customization capability empowers users to precisely align their data setup with their workflow, promote optimal efficiency and productivity by using variables to meet their unique needs.

#### How to Create a New Variable in AIRA:

- In the job section > workflow designer access the module list.
- Locate the "Variable" option within the module list and click on it to access the Variables interface.
- Within the Variable Section, find the option to add a new variable and click on it to initiate the variable creation process.
- A new window will appear, prompting you to enter information for the new variable:
  - Variable Type: Select the appropriate variable type from the options available in AIRA (e.g., string, integer, float, boolean, datetime, grid, array, file, multiple files, object).
  - Name: Provide a descriptive name for the variable to identify it within your workflow.
  - Description: Optionally, provide a brief description or purpose statement for the variable to clarify its intended use.
  - Default Value: If applicable, specify a default value for the variable to be used in cases where no explicit value is assigned.
- After entering all the required information, click on the "Submit" button to save the newly created variable.
- If you decide not to proceed with creating the variable, you can click on the "Cancel" button next to the "Submit" button to abort the process and return to the Variable Section without saving changes.
